# Problem Statement
---> As today's the world is growing faster and so the technologies, so doing anything manual is not preferable nowadays because manual doing is slower,less efficient and even          more time consuming.

---> Automation is the need of today's generation and here I came up with the automation within integration and deployment of our projects on the server-side so that whenever          Developer finishes writting the code or change something into the code, within one click, the changes will be updated on the server and client can see the changes on their        end without any breakdown in the site or anything else like that. 

# Requirements
# Tools & Technologies Used
  Continuous Integration Tools used to accomplish this automation are as follows:-
  1. GIT
  2. GITHUB
  3. JENKINS
  
  * GIT -  Git is an open-source tool developers install locally to manage source code. For more info refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git
  * GITHUB - GitHub is an online service to which developers who use Git can connect and upload or download resources. For more info refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub
  * JENKINS - Jenkins is used to build and test your software projects continuously making it easier for developers to integrate changes to the project, and making it easier for       users to obtain a fresh build. For more info connect to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jenkins_(software)
  
  Technology which I used here for continuous deployment is  <b>DOCKER Containerization</b> and OS I used here is  <b>RHEL8</b>
